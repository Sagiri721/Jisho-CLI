# Flashcards
A flashcard collection is a sqlite3 database, the program searches for database files on this directory ans displays the card it thinks is more appropriate.
<br>There is no need to add example sentences / definitions / readings as the program searches for those automatically.

## Flashcard database tools
The database contains information on what cards were already displayed so you might want to clean that information if you didn't create the collection yourself.
